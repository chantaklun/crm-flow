# ADR-001: Program Architecture Overview

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Deciders:** Program Orchestrator, Technical Lead, Architecture Team  
**Tags:** architecture, infrastructure, program-management

## Context

The CRM application needs to scale from a development prototype to a production-ready system supporting 10,000 concurrent users. This requires:

- Clear architectural principles and patterns
- Structured approach to production readiness
- Coordinated work across multiple technical domains
- Quality and reliability guarantees (SLOs)
- Cost-effective Azure cloud deployment

We need an architectural framework that guides the transformation while maintaining system coherence and team alignment.

## Decision

We adopt a **multi-layered architecture** with the following structure:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Next.js 15)
- **React Server Components (RSC)** for data-fetching components
- **Client Components** only where interactivity is required
- **App Router** with file-based routing
- **Streaming** and progressive rendering for improved UX
- **Metadata API** for SEO and social sharing

### 2. Application Layer
- **Server Actions** for mutations and form handling
- **Route Handlers** for REST API endpoints
- **Middleware** for cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, rate limiting)
- **TypeScript contracts** with Zod validation

### 3. Data Access Layer
- **Service Layer** abstracting data operations
- **Repository Pattern** for entity access
- **Query Optimization** with indexes and connection pooling
- **Multi-tier Caching** (app fetch cache, distributed cache, CDN)

### 4. Infrastructure Layer (Azure)
- **Azure App Service** for hosting with managed scaling
- **Azure Front Door** for global distribution and WAF
- **Azure Key Vault** for secrets management
- **Azure Application Insights** for observability
- **Deployment Slots** for blue-green deployments

### 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Authentication/Authorization** with Azure AD and RBAC
- **Observability** with distributed tracing, metrics, and logs
- **Security** with CSP, WAF, and vulnerability management
- **Quality Gates** enforced in CI/CD pipeline

### Program Structure

The transformation is organized into **6 Epics** executed over **4 Program Increments (PIs)**:

1. **Production Readiness** (PI-1): Next.js optimization
2. **Azure Baseline** (PI-2): Cloud infrastructure
3. **Data/API Scale** (PI-2): Data layer optimization
4. **Observability & Quality** (PI-2, PI-3): Testing and monitoring
5. **Security & Compliance** (PI-3): Security hardening
6. **Product Enhancements** (PI-3+): Enterprise features

**Specialized Sub-Agents** own epic execution with clear inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has well-defined responsibilities
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling to 10K users
- **Maintainability**: Modular structure enables independent evolution
- **Performance**: RSC, caching, and CDN optimize load times
- **Reliability**: Azure managed services provide HA and DR
- **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
- **Team Alignment**: Epic-based organization with clear ownership

### Negative Consequences

- **Complexity**: More layers and components to understand and maintain
- **Azure Lock-in**: Deep integration with Azure services
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Next.js 15, RSC, Azure services
- **Migration Effort**: Current Firebase backend needs migration
- **Cost**: Azure infrastructure has monthly operational costs

### Risks

- **Risk:** RSC patterns not well-understood by team
  - **Mitigation:** Training, documentation, code reviews, gradual adoption

- **Risk:** Azure costs exceed budget
  - **Mitigation:** Budget alerts, autoscaling limits, cost dashboards, optimization

- **Risk:** Performance targets not achievable
  - **Mitigation:** Early prototyping, incremental optimization, load testing

- **Risk:** Coordination challenges across sub-agents
  - **Mitigation:** Weekly sync, Projects v2 tracking, clear interfaces

## Implementation Notes

**Timeline:** 12 weeks (4 PIs Ã— 3 weeks each)  

**Dependencies:**
- Azure subscription with appropriate quotas
- GitHub Projects v2 access
- Sub-agent specifications and tooling

**Key Phases:**
1. **PI-0 (Weeks 1-2):** Foundation and assessment
2. **PI-1 (Weeks 3-5):** Production hardening
3. **PI-2 (Weeks 6-9):** Azure baseline and data/API scale
4. **PI-3 (Weeks 10-12):** Security and quality validation

**Success Criteria:**
- All SLO targets met (99.9% availability, p95 <300ms, <0.1% errors)
- Core Web Vitals passing (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- Load test validates 10K concurrent user capacity
- Cost within budget ($5K/month for dev+staging)
- 80%+ epics delivered on-time
